# Unit Testing with NUnit, xUnit, and MSTest

## Description

This project is a collection of examples and best practices for unit testing with three popular testing frameworks in C#: NUnit, xUnit, and MSTest. The code samples demonstrate how to write and run tests, create test fixtures and suites, use assertions, and mock dependencies.
The project is designed to help developers of all levels improve their unit testing skills and adopt a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. The code is organized by framework, with each framework containing multiple test cases and fixtures that cover a wide range of scenarios.
